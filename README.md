# Flower Prediction Using Machine Learning and HTML

This project demonstrates how to predict the species of flowers using machine learning (ML) and display the results through a simple HTML interface. The model uses the popular **Iris dataset** containing flower features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to predict the flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).

## Project Overview

1. **Machine Learning Model**: 
   - The model is trained using the **Iris dataset** and classifies flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The classification model used is a **Random Forest Classifier** from **scikit-learn**.
   - The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file for easy integration into a web application.

2. **Backend API (Flask)**: 
   - The Flask web server serves as the backend to load and run the machine learning model. It listens for incoming requests containing flower feature data, makes predictions, and sends back the predicted flower species as a response.
   
3. **Frontend (HTML)**:
   - A simple HTML form allows the user to input flower features such as sepal and petal dimensions.
   - JavaScript is used to send the form data to the Flask API and display the predicted flower species on the webpage.

## Key Features

- **User Input**: Users can input the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of the flower via a simple HTML form.
- **Model Prediction**: The form sends the input data to the Flask backend, where the trained machine learning model predicts the flower species.
- **Result Display**: The predicted species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) is displayed on the webpage.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: 
  - **Python** and **scikit-learn** for building and training the machine learning model.
  - **Joblib** for saving and loading the trained model.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Flask** for creating the web API to handle prediction requests and serve the trained model.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML** for creating the user interface (form) to accept flower features.
  - **JavaScript (Fetch API)** for sending the input data to the Flask backend and receiving the prediction.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Node.js (for running the frontend locally)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-prediction.git
cd flower-prediction
```

### 2. Set up the Python Environment

Create a virtual environment to install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model (Optional)

If you don't have the pre-trained model (`flower_model.pkl`), you can train it by running the following Python script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will train the model using the Iris dataset and save it as `flower_model.pkl`.

### 4. Run the Flask API

Once the environment is set up and the model is trained, run the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask app will start running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 5. Open the HTML Frontend

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the flower prediction interface. The form will allow you to input the flower's features and get the predicted species.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters flower features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) into the HTML form.
2. **Data Submission**: When the user clicks the "Predict Flower" button, the form data is sent to the Flask API.
3. **Prediction**: The backend Flask server loads the trained machine learning model and uses it to predict the flower species based on the input features.
4. **Display Result**: The predicted species is returned to the frontend and displayed on the webpage.

## Sample Input and Output

### Input:
- Sepal Length: 5.1
- Sepal Width: 3.5
- Petal Length: 1.4

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet powerful application that combines machine learning and web development. The Flask backend handles the prediction, while the frontend HTML form allows users to input data and view the results in real-time. By combining Python's powerful data science tools with basic web technologies, you can create an interactive predictive application.
